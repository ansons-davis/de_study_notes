### **Additional Study Tips**

- **30:30 Approach:** Spend 30 minutes reading, then 30 minutes summarizing or reflecting.
- **The Feynman Technique:** Try to explain concepts in simple terms to reinforce understanding.
- **Monthly Deep Dive:** Once a month, dedicate a week to a single topic for deeper study (e.g., "Infrastructure Week" or "Streaming Week").
